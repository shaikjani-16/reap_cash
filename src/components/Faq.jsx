    question: "How do I qualify for a cash advance?",
    answer:
      "To qualify for a cash advance with Reap Cash, you need to be an active short-term rental host with a good booking history. We look at factors such as your average booking rate, occupancy, and overall account health. Generally, if you have consistent bookings and a good track record, you're likely to qualify.",
  },
  {
    question: "What platforms do you integrate with?",
    answer:
      "We currently integrate with major short-term rental platforms including Airbnb, VRBO, and Booking.com. We're constantly working on expanding our integrations to support more platforms. If you use a platform we don't currently support, please reach out to us.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if a guest cancels?",
    answer:
      "If a guest cancels a booking for which you've received an advance, you won't be required to repay that portion of the advance. Our model is designed to protect hosts from cancellation risks. We only collect repayment when the guest's stay is completed and you receive payment.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my data secure?",
    answer:
      "Yes, we take data security very seriously. We use bank-level encryption and security measures to protect your personal and financial information. We never store your platform login credentials, and we're compliant with all relevant data protection regulations.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are there any hidden fees?",
    answer:
      "No, we pride ourselves on transparency. The only fee we charge is the clearly stated 2% per advance. There are no hidden fees, no origination fees, and no early repayment penalties. What you see is what you get.",
